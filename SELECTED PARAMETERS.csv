Exoplanet Archive Information,koi_disposition,,,
Project Disposition Columns,koi_fpflag_nt,Not Transit-Like Flag,"A KOI whose light curve is not consistent with that of a transiting planet. This includes, but is not limited to, instrumental artifacts, non-eclipsing variable stars, and spurious (very low SNR) detections.",
Project Disposition Columns,koi_fpflag_ss,"	Stellar Eclipse Flag","A KOI that is observed to have a significant secondary event, transit shape, or out-of-eclipse variability, which indicates that the transit-like event is most likely caused by an eclipsing binary. However, self-luminous, hot Jupiters with a visible secondary eclipse will also have this flag set, but with a disposition of PC.",
Project Disposition Columns,koi_fpflag_co,Centroid Offset Flag,"The source of the signal is from a nearby star, as inferred by measuring the centroid location of the image both in and out of transit, or by the strength of the transit signal in the target's outer (halo) pixels as compared to the transit signal from the pixels in the optimal (or core) aperture.",
Project Disposition Columns,koi_fpflag_ec,Ephemeris Match Indicates Contamination Flag,The KOI shares the same period and epoch as another object and is judged to be the result of flux contamination in the aperture or electronic crosstalk.,

Transit Properties,koi_duration,Transit Duration (hours),"The duration of the observed transits. Duration is measured from first contact between the planet and star until last contact. Contact times are typically computed from a best-fit model produced by a Mandel-Agol (2002) model fit to a multi-quarter Kepler light curve, assuming a linear orbital ephemeris.",

Transit Properties,koi_teq,"	Equilibrium Temperature (Kelvin)","Approximation for the temperature of the planet. The calculation of equilibrium temperature assumes a) thermodynamic equilibrium between the incident stellar flux and the radiated heat from the planet, b) a Bond albedo (the fraction of total power incident upon the planet scattered back into space) of 0.3, c) the planet and star are blackbodies, and d) the heat is evenly distributed between the day and night sides of the planet.",
Transit Properties,koi_insol,Insolation Flux [Earth flux],"Insolation flux is another way to give the equilibrium temperature. It depends on the stellar parameters (specifically the stellar radius and temperature), and on the semi-major axis of the planet. It's given in units relative to those measured for the Earth from the Sun.",
